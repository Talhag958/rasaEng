Hi all,
Today I  will show you how to connect your Rasa bot to a webchat.
first I will show how to connect using a script tag and than as a react component

Step1: Once you have your bot ready and then we can connect the bot with the webchat

so add the below congfiguration in the credentials.yml file:
socketio:
  user_message_evt: user_uttered
  bot_message_evt: bot_uttered
  session_persistence: true
you can read more about this in the link below:

https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide...

Step2: Now  let us start our bot using the below command:

rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug

Step3: Now you can see different api details for our rasa bot server
 Now we can connect our bot to a webpage using the webchat script

https://github.com/mrbot-ai/rasa-webchat

now create a webpage and add the below code:

copy the code from the above link and paste it in the body tag

step4: Now change the socket url port number to our rasa server's port number

Step5: Now let's test our bot

Now you can see we got the response

so we have succesfully connected our bot to a webpage

In my next video, I will show you how to connect the bot as a React component
